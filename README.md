# speech signal analysis and processing / Spoken Language Processing

##  Overview
This repository contains the first assignment for **Spoken Language Processing** at Birzeit University. The assignment explores various aspects of **speech signal analysis, synthesis, and processing** through several interconnected experiments.

##  Contents
- **Research Paper:** `speech signal analysis.pdf` (Full detailed report)
- **MATLAB & Python Code:**
  - `code/matlab/` - MATLAB scripts for signal processing tasks
  - `code/python/` - Python scripts for formant analysis and synthesis
- **Audio Files:**
  - `data/audio_samples/` - Speech samples used in experiments
- **Figures & Results:**
  - `docs/figures/` - Spectrograms, plots, and analysis results

##  Objective
This assignment aims to provide practical insights into:
- **Speech production mechanics** (formants, spectrograms, and phonemes)
- **Speech signal processing techniques** (filtering, spectral analysis, and synthesis)
- **Concatenative speech synthesis** (sub-word and phone-level)
- **Source-filter modeling for vowel generation**
- **Ethical and technical considerations in speech technology**

##  How to Use This Repository
- Use this as a **reference** for speech processing assignments or research projects.
- Study **formant analysis, spectrogram visualization, and speech synthesis techniques**.
- Run the provided MATLAB and Python code for hands-on experimentation.
